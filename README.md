## Overview

In this project, I proposed a **Ruby on Rails** application with online drawing as its core function. It's more of an experimental drawing tool where users can choose among 3 different brushes and draw with random generated colors.

The project name, _Hua_(ç”»), is the literal meaning of drawing in Chinese.

I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript/jQuery for the front-end part, and it's also my first experiment with **HTML5 Canvas** technology.   


## Features

- Every time when users reload the page, change a brush or clear the canvas, there will be a new monochrome background.

- 3 brushes to experiment with, click and then move mouse to draw.

- In basic brush mode, you can choose 3 different brush sizes.

- Users can either save their drawings to computer or upload to the online gallery, where I use [Cloudinary](http://cloudinary.com/) as cloud storage service

- Users can browse other users' works and leave a comment.
