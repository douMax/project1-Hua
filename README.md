## Acknowledgments

- I used [animate.css](https://github.com/daneden/animate.css) library during the process, it's an easy-to-use library of CSS animations!

- I used [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/) to search for icons.

- I found my color palette for this game on [Coolors](https://coolors.co/).

- I found my cute sushi tokens on [freepik](http://www.freepik.com/).

- I've felt grateful for all the help I got from Luke & Matt and all my classmates along the way in WDI22, Sydney,  [GA](https://generalassemb.ly/).
