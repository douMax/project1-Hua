## Overview

In this project, I proposed a **Ruby on Rails** application with online drawing as its core function. It's more of an experimental drawing tool where users can choose among 3 different brushes and draw with random generated colors.

The project name, _Hua_(ç”»), is the literal meaning of drawing in Chinese.

I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript/jQuery for the front-end part, and it's also my first experiment with **HTML5 Canvas** technology.   


## Features

- Players can toggle between **Versus Mode** and **VS Computer Mode** on 3x3 grid

- Beat-me-if-you-can AI

- Players can toggle between 3x3 or 4x4 grid
